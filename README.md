Classification of the IRIS dataset with a neural network made from scratch.
The IRIS dataset can be downloaded from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris

The "train_model.py" is responsible with training the neural network while with the "data_loader.py" I indended to make the data set more suitable for the neural net (see the docstring).
Achieves 100% accuracy on unseen data.
